  // Step 1: Generate SQL using GPT
  const sqlPrompt = `
    You are an expert SQL generator. Based on the following database schema, convert the given natural language input into a valid, readable SQL query.

    Schema:
    - users(_id, username, password, firstName, lastName, email, dob, role)
    - courses(_id, name, number, description)
    - enrollments(_id, course, user, status)
    - quizzes(_id, name, course, instruction, num_of_questions, quiz_type, points, assignment_group, difficulty)
    - questions(_id, type, quiz, description, points, possible_answers, correct_answer)
    - attempts(_id, user, quiz, attemptCount, score, submissionTime)
    - answers(attempt_id, question_id, user_answer)
    - messages(_id, sender_id, receiver_id, subject, content, sendTime)

    Your task:
    - Use only the tables and columns specified above.
    - Use JOINs where needed to include relevant information.
    - Use meaningful column aliases with human-friendly labels (e.g., "Student Name", "Email", "Course Title").
    - Concatenate firstName and lastName as full names if needed.
    - If the query is about the current user (e.g. contains "my", "me", or "I"), filter using the provided user ID.
    - To accurately reflect the user's best performance, we consider only the highest score of all attempts per quiz for that user
    - Return only the SQL query, without any explanations.

    Current userID: "${userId}"
